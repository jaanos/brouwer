# A. E. Brouwer's tables of strongly regular and distance-regular graphs

This repository contains a mirror image of the data on graphs from Andries E. Brouwer's [homepage](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/). The webpages are downloaded daily, with git providing the ability to track changes.

Currently, the following pages are mirrored:
* [Descriptions of various graphs](graphs/), containing also the [tables of feasible parameters for strongly regular graphs](graphs/srg/srgtab.html)
* [Tables of feasible intersection arrays for distance-regular graphs](drg/drgtables.html)
